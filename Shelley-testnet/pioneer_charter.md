## PIONEER CHARTER

The early stage of the testnet will require pool operators to commit to undertake certain activities and collaborate closely. Therefore we are you to make some formal commitments; by taking part in our testnet program, as a ‘pioneer’ pool operator you will:

1. Commit to min. __6 hours per week__ on the program during its duration
2. Commit to working with IOHK, CF and fellow participants to undertake specific __tests__, help improve draft __documentation__ and provide general __feedback regularly and promptly
3. Commit to __keep the wider community informed__ about progress in a collaborative and constructive way
4. Commit to nominating __a minimum of 2 further pool operators__ to invite and mentor as Pioneers during the course of the 	testnet and do appropriate due diligence
5. Recognise that this is a __Testnet__ and that there is no direct reward for involvement, other than __serving the community and building own knowledge__
