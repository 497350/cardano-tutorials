# Configuring Logging

Here we will look at various ways to control _log output_ generated by the node.
We assume that you have built a node and are able to run it with our own custom configuration, which is described in [this tutorial](build.md)
and in [this tutorial](ekg.md).

When you start the node using the default configuration,
logging is switched on, log output is directed to the console and to a (rolling) file in folder `logs/`,
minimal severity is `Notice`,
and verbosity is _normal_.
We will see how to change all of these and more in this tutorial using various options in the configuration file.

1. We can disable logging completely by setting `TurnOnLoggin` to `False`:

        TurnOnLogging: False

2. Log messages come with different severities (`Debug`, `Info`, `Notice` and `Warning` and `Error`), and we can specify the _minimal_ severity
   of messages that will be passed on (the the console, a file or another logging backend). Messages with a lower severity will be suppressed.
   By changing this minimal severity to `Debug`, we will therefore see messages of all severities;
   by changing it to `Error`, we will only see the most severe messages:

        minSeverity: Debug

   The severity is displayed in the beginning of each log message (in this example, there is one message with severity `Debug`,
   and there are two with severity `Notice`):

   __Note:__ Lowering the minimal severity harms _efficiency_,
   so while using a low severity can be very helpful for debugging a problem, it should be used with care during normal operation.
   The same is true for other options which produce more logging output described below.

3. In addition to _severity_, log messages come with _verbosity_, which can be `MinimalVerbosity`, `NormalVerbosity` or `MaximalVerbosity`.
   Changing the verbosity will not change _which_ messages will be displayed, 
   but the amount of information contained in each message.
